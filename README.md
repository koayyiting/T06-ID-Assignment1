# Overview of my Project
This is my project which is designed based on a topic given which is "Build a personal protfolio site". The overview of my website is a personal portfolio which its goal its to present myself best in my website and get hired. So this website would include my Personal Information like My Education Journey, Interest, My Previous Projects and My Contacts. 

As I have mentioned, my Goal is to present myself and get hired. So after looking through my personal portfolio, it must be able to let the recruiters find my portfolio good. So users using my website will be able to know about me. They are able to navigate to pages to show more information of myself. They are also able to send emails to contact me at the Contacts Page.

## Design Process
My Design Process for this website is to let users able to use the website easily like being able to click on the functions that are suppose to work (navigation tab). Information should be easily understand by the user and it should be eye appealing for the user to have a good impression of myself to let myself get a higher chance to get recruited. My project include the navigation tabs, organized and well structured information displayed and as well as able to visit my website on their phones. So the nagivation tab is a section where users will be able to navigate to other pages to view th other content about my website. The informations are also displayed in an organized order and not too lengthy for the users to read. 

- As a user type, I want to press the navigation buttons, so that I am able to navgiate to other pages.
- As a user type, I want to enter the contact page and press the link to email, so that I am able to contact the person.
- As a user type, I want to press the buttons on the Education page, to see the other photos

## Technologies Used

## Testing

1. Navigation Tab:
    1. Go to the Navigation Tab
    (Since one page include 2 content, tab buttons need to link to page and page section)
    2. Try to navigate to another page's section

2. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact" Page
    2. Try to press the email link, it will need to direct you to mail
    3. Both link would direct to mail

3. LinkedIn Link:
    1. Go to the "Contact" Page
    2. Try to press the LinkedIn button, it should navigate you to my LinkedIn Profile
    3. You should still be able to go back the my website as the Linkedin Profile would be open using new tab

4. Changing of Image:
    1. Go to the "Education" Page
    2. Try to press the "next" button, the picture should change
    3. Try to press the "next" button again, it will revert back to the first image

## How my project will looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes

- When the size is down to width 576px, sizes of different content will strink. Flex-box will also be utilised so the users would still be able to see the informations in the flex-boxes which means the arrangement of the Website will be slightly different from what users can see on thier laptop/computer. 

## Interesting bugs or problems I discovered during my testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet

Using the validation check, i realise that my img src did not add the alt, which it should have so I have alt for all of them and the error is fixed. 
Javascript onclick button implementation does not work.
