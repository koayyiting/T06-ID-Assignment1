One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

This is my project which is designed based on a topic given which is "Build a personal protfolio site". The overview of my website is a personal portfolio which its goal its to present myself best in my website and get hired. So this website would include my Personal Information like My Education Journey, Interest, My Previous Projects and My Contacts. 

As I have mentioned, my Goal is to present myself and get hired. So after looking through my personal portfolio, it must be able to let the recruiters find my portfolio good. So users using my website will be able to know about me. They are able to navigate to pages to show more information of myself. [They are also able to send emails to contact me at the Contacts Page.]

## Design Process (half done)

Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

My Design Process for this website is to let users able to use the website easily like being able to click on the functions that are suppose to work (navigation tab). Information should be easily understand by the user and it should be eye appealing for the user to have a good impression of myself to let myself get a higher chance to get recruited. My project include the navigation tabs, organized and well structured information displayed and as well as able to visit my website on their phones. So the nagivation tab is a section where users will be able to navigate to other pages to view th other content about my website. The informations are also displayed in an organized order and not too lengthy for the users to read. 

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
- (idk what this talking about)

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

## Features (not done)

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Existing Features (half done)

- Feature 1 - On the Navigation tab, it allows users to navigate to other page, by having them on click to the navigation button.

### Features Left to Implement (done)

- Contact Form

## Technologies Used (not done)

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [HTML]
- [CSS]
- [JAVASCRIPT]

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing (not done)

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
