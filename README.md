# Overview of my Project
This is my project which is designed based on a topic given which is "Build a personal protfolio site". The overview of my website is a personal portfolio which its goal its to present myself best in my website and get hired. So this website would include my Personal Information like My Education Journey, Interest, My Previous Projects and My Contacts. 

As I have mentioned, my Goal is to present myself and get hired. So after looking through my personal portfolio, it must be able to let the recruiters find my portfolio good. So users using my website will be able to know about me. They are able to navigate to pages to show more information of myself. [They are also able to send emails to contact me at the Contacts Page.]

## Design Process (half done)
My Design Process for this website is to let users able to use the website easily like being able to click on the functions that are suppose to work (navigation tab). Information should be easily understand by the user and it should be eye appealing for the user to have a good impression of myself to let myself get a higher chance to get recruited. My project include the navigation tabs, organized and well structured information displayed and as well as able to visit my website on their phones. So the nagivation tab is a section where users will be able to navigate to other pages to view th other content about my website. The informations are also displayed in an organized order and not too lengthy for the users to read. 

- As a user type, I want to press the navigation buttons, so that I am able to navgiate to other pages.
- As a user type, I want to enter the contact page, so that I am able to contact the person.
- As a creater type, I want to be able to receive the recruiter contact, so I can contact them.
