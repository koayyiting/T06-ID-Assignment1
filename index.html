            Hello! I am Koay Yi Ting, a student from Ngee Ann Polytechnic.
            As an introvert, I enjoy staying at home, doing my own things.
            But I am also a person who cherish my family and friends and I like
            to go outings with them. My hobby is playing Badminton and watching
            Youtube, Netflix and Viu.

            This is my first year as an NP student. My Aim is slightly different from My Primary and Secondary
            School, I want to focus more on my studies and skills for IT. Since IT is kind of new to me,
            yet I am interested in it, so I would need to work hard to catch up. And My knowlegde of IT would
            be crucial for my future career opportunity and choices.

    <p>In secondary school, I was in Design and Technology and I like to sketch or draw once in a while when I have
      the time to do so.</p>

        Since I like to design, draw and create things, that could 
        suggest that I am quite a creative person which I think I am
        able to create creative front-end, user interaction.

        <h5>Innovation Social Entrepreneurship(ISE)/ <br>
        Values In Action(VIA) Project </h5>
            <p>
            This is an Annual programme planned by our school where groups from cohort would
            need think of a solution with a given topic. And our topic was "Improving a life
            of an elderly". <br>
            So our group came up with a solution of advanced 4 legged crutches where it have 
            many technology functions. <br>
            This project gave me an opportunity to visit Taiwan and attend the "Design For 
            Change Taiwan Be The Change Global Conference" with another 9 schoolmates. <br>
            This During the conference students from different countries presented how they 
            helped the people from their country. From there I learnt that there is no age 
            restriction to who can help the others' make their lives better and motivate the 
            older ones to also want to be like them and help the others.
