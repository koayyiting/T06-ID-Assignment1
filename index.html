            Hello! I am Koay Yi Ting, a student from Ngee Ann Polytechnic.
            As an introvert, I enjoy staying at home, doing my own things.
            But I am also a person who cherish my family and friends and I like
            to go outings with them. My hobby is playing Badminton and watching
            Youtube, Netflix and Viu.

          <p>
            This is my first year as an NP student. My Aim is slightly different from My Primary and Secondary
            School, I want to focus more on my studies and skills for IT. Since IT is kind of new to me,
            yet I am interested in it, so I would need to work hard to catch up. And My knowlegde of IT would
            be crucial for my future career opportunity and choices.
