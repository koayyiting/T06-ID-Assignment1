            <p>
            This is my first year as an NP student. My Aim is slightly different from My Primary and Secondary
            School, I want to focus more on my studies and skills for IT. Since IT is kind of new to me,
            yet I am interested in it, so I would need to work hard to catch up. And My knowlegde of IT would
            be crucial for my future career opportunity and choices.

    <h2>My Interest</h2>
    <p>In secondary school, I was in Design and Technology and I like to sketch or draw once in a while when I have
      the time to do so.</p>

    <p>
        Since I like to design, draw and create things, that could 
        suggest that I am quite a creative person which I think I am
        able to create creative front-end, user interaction.
