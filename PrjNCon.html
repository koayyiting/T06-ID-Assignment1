        <h3>Project 1</h3>
        <h5>Innovation Social Entrepreneurship(ISE)/ <br>
        Values In Action(VIA) Project </h5>
            <p>
            This is an Annual programme planned by our school where groups from cohort would
            need think of a solution with a given topic. And our topic was "Improving a life
            of an elderly". <br>
            So our group came up with a solution of advanced 4 legged crutches where it have 
            many technology functions. <br>
            This project gave me an opportunity to visit Taiwan and attend the "Design For 
            Change Taiwan Be The Change Global Conference" with another 9 schoolmates. <br>
            This During the conference students from different countries presented how they 
            helped the people from their country. From there I learnt that there is no age 
            restriction to who can help the others' make their lives better and motivate the 
            older ones to also want to be like them and help the others.
