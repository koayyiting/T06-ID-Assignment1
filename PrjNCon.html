            <h5>Innovation Social Entrepreneurship(ISE)/ <br>
            Values In Action(VIA) Project </h5>
                <p>
                    This is an Annual programme planned by our school where groups from cohort would
                    need think of a solution with a given topic. And our topic was "Improving a life
                    of an elderly". <br>
                    So our group came up with a solution of advanced 4 legged crutches where it have 
                    many technology functions. <br>
                    This project gave me an opportunity to visit Taiwan and attend the "Design For 
                    Change Taiwan Be The Change Global Conference" with another 9 schoolmates. <br>
                    This During the conference students from different countries presented how they 
                    helped the people from their country. From there I learnt that there is no age 
                    restriction to who can help the others' make their lives better and motivate the 
                    older ones to also want to be like them and help the others.

                    Topic of "Combining" was given for our O Levels.<br>
                    So I created a handphone stand where user could watch their phone while lying
